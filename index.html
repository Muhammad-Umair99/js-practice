Detailed Example
Let’s use n = 5 to walk through the loop:

Initial Values: result = 1, current = 5
First Iteration:
result *= current → result = 1 * 5 = 5
current-- → current = 4
Second Iteration:
result *= current → result = 5 * 4 = 20
current-- → current = 3
Third Iteration:
result *= current → result = 20 * 3 = 60
current-- → current = 2
Fourth Iteration:
result *= current → result = 60 * 2 = 120
current-- → current = 1
Fifth Iteration:
result *= current → result = 120 * 1 = 120
current-- → current = 0
Loop Ends: Since current is now 0, the loop exits. where we write that  current values become zero explain me -->
